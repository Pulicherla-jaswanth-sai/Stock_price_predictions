# Stock_price_predictions
Welcome to my Stock Price Predictions project! This is where I explore how we can use data and machine learning to make sense of the stock market and try to predict future prices.

ðŸŒŸ What This Project Is About:
Using real historical stock data, Iâ€™ve built a few models to forecast how stock prices might move. Itâ€™s a mix of data science, finance, and a bit of fun trying to outsmart the market (or at least understand it better).

ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Inside:
Clean and prep stock market data from sources like Yahoo Finance

Visualize price trends and patterns

Try out models like Linear Regression, ARIMA, and even LSTM neural networks

Compare how well each model predicts and learn from the results

Plenty of charts and insights to help you see whatâ€™s going on

ðŸ§° Tools I Used:
Python (with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, etc.)

Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation

Matplotlib and Plotly for beautiful, interactive graphs

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This:
Iâ€™m fascinated by the stock market and curious about how much of it we can actually model and predict. This project was a great way to learn more about time series forecasting and machine learning, all while working on something practical and interesting.
